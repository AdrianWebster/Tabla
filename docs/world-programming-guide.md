# Programmer's Guide

This file explains how to create a new GameWorld mode for Tabla. Tabla leans heavily on libcinder and OpenCV, but you don't need to understand everything to write a new game mode. You do need to know C++, and some experience with OpenGL helps. To do more advanced projects you'll need to dig into OpenCV yourself.

If you haven't already, you should read through installation.md, as it covers basic concepts this file assumes you know. While it's not necessary to have digested the architecture.md guide, it will be helpful to know this in order to do projects involving more advanced OpenCV techniques.
