# Application

- [ ] Put lightlink.xml in settings.xml (i think it's a good idea...; maybe not?)
- [x] Make polygon xml into a list of vertices inside of polygon block: e.g. <v>x1 y1</v> <v>x2 y2</v> etc... (will make file look less crazy).
- [ ] Move settings to /Library
- [ ] Each GameWorld can have their own settings (either in settings.xml, or in per-game files). e.g. for which way is up
- [ ] Automatic projector calibration. (And rename CalibateWorld to CameraCalibrateWorld; add a ProjectorCalibrateWorld that does this). Simply project a box in known projector space, find it in world space, then use that perspective transform to set the projector profile's mProjectorCoords.
- Game controller
	- [ ] Move to App, not just Pinball
	- [ ] allow multiple controller profiles (PS4, Xbox, etc...).
- [ ] Move RectFinder into Vision pipeline
